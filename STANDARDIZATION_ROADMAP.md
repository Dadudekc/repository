# Standardization Roadmap

Below is an actionable roadmap to bring all repositories to a unified, well-documented, and testable standard.

---

## 1. Expand Setup & Testing Across Repositories
- **Inventory Repos:** List every repository in scope; note language, framework, and intended deployment targets.
- **Bootstrap Scripts:** Provide a common setup script (e.g., `setup.sh` or `Makefile`), ensuring consistent environment creation and dependency installation.
- **Testing Templates:** Create a reusable testing scaffold (e.g., `tests/` with example tests, pytest config, coverage setup) and replicate across repos.
- **Automation:** Ensure tests run locally via a single command and are triggered in CI.

## 2. Security Reviews & Performance Optimization
- **Security Checklist:** Establish a checklist (dependency scanning, static analysis, secrets scanning) and schedule reviews.
- **Performance Baseline:** Define key metrics (response time, memory usage) and integrate profiling into CI pipelines.
- **Dependency Updates:** Use tools (e.g., `pip-audit`, `npm audit`) regularly; integrate automated alerts for vulnerabilities.

## 3. Deployment & Community Engagement Plans
- **Deployment Templates:** Create a standard deployment workflow (container build, staging environments, release tags).
- **Documentation:** For each repo, document deployment steps and rollback strategy.
- **Community Guidelines:** Develop contributing norms, code of conduct, and a communication channel (e.g., mailing list, Discord).

## 4. Repository Naming Conventions
- **Naming Standard:** Adopt a format like `org-project` or `scope-project`; document it in an engineering handbook.
- **Renaming Process:** For existing repos, schedule renames and update references (CI, scripts, documentation).

## 5. Dependency Audits & Requirements Files
- **Audit Process:** Run dependency-check tools; record missing or outdated packages.
- **Requirements Files:** Ensure every language ecosystem uses a canonical dependency file (`requirements.txt`, `package.json`, etc.).
- **Lockfiles:** Encourage lockfiles (`poetry.lock`, `package-lock.json`) for deterministic builds.

## 6. Standard Project Structure
- **Template Repos:** Offer starter repo templates with the agreed layout (`src/`, `tests/`, `docs/`, etc.).
- **Migration Guide:** Provide instructions for restructuring legacy projects without breaking builds.
- **Consistency Checks:** Add linters or scripts verifying structure (e.g., required folders, README, license).

## 7. Documentation Enhancements
- **CONTRIBUTING.md:** Include guidelines on coding style, commit messages, pull requests, and code review.
- **API Docs:** Generate from source comments (Sphinx, JSDoc) and host via GitHub Pages or an internal portal.
- **Troubleshooting:** For common errors or setup issues, maintain a `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` with solutions.

## 8. Code Quality Improvements
- **gitignore & Formatting:** Standardize `.gitignore` and formatter configs (Prettier, Black). Automate lint/format in pre-commit.
- **Type Hints & Error Handling:** Encourage static typing (mypy, TypeScript) and consistent exception strategy (custom exceptions, logging).
- **Code Reviews:** Enforce review standards with checklists (naming, docstrings, error paths).

## 9. Basic Tests & CI/CD Templates
- **Test Skeleton:** Provide minimal test examples and helpers (fixtures, factories).
- **CI/CD Templates:** Maintain baseline GitHub Actions or other CI configs for build, test, lint, and deploy.
- **Badge & Status Reporting:** Add badges to README for build/test status and code coverage.

### Recommended Next Steps
1. **Set Up a Template Repository:** Contain the standard structure, docs, test skeleton, CI config, and bootstrap scripts.
2. **Create Playbook:** Document each of the above practices in a central engineering handbook.
3. **Pilot on a Single Repository:** Apply changes to one repo as a proof-of-concept, then roll out sequentially.
4. **Schedule Regular Audits:** Monthly or quarterly checks for security, dependency updates, and policy adherence.
5. **Community Engagement:** Announce standards, solicit feedback, and host a session to walk through the new structure.

This plan establishes consistent quality, maintainability, and community involvement across all repositories.
