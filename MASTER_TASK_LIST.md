  - Note missing dependencies and update installation scripts
- [ ] Start basic testing on completed features
  - Run existing test suites or create minimal tests where absent
  - Record failures and needed fixes
- [ ] Document progress
  - Update READMEs or docs in each active repository
  - Summarize environment setup status and blockers
- [ ] Assess overlap between trading bot projects
  - Compare `trading-platform`, `osrs-bot`, and `tbow-tactics` for shared modules
  - List components that can be merged or reused
- [ ] Assess overlap between data management projects
  - Review `Datgurll` and `machine-learning-project` for redundant utilities
  - Identify opportunities for unification
- [ ] Create consolidation plans as needed
  - Decide which repositories to merge, archive, or standardize
  - Outline migration steps and responsible parties
- [ ] Update documentation after consolidation assessment
  - Reflect consolidation decisions in repository READMEs and this master list
  - Note next steps for merged projects

### **🎯 This Month**
- [ ] Expand setup and testing across additional repositories
- [ ] Plan security reviews and performance optimization
