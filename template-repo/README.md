# Template Repository

This repository provides a standard project structure that can be copied when creating new projects. It includes:

- A `src/` directory for source code
- A `tests/` directory with a sample test
- A basic `setup.sh` script for dependency installation
- A minimal GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration

Use this template as a starting point for new repositories to ensure consistency across projects.
