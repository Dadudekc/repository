Total: 34 placeholder directories identified.

## Environment Setup Progress (2025-08-08)
- `trading-platform`: Added `pytest` to requirements and basic import tests for `pandas`, `numpy`, and `yfinance`.
- `gpt-automation`: Added `pytest` and import tests for `openai` and `langchain`.
- `unified-workspace`: Migration tool import test passes; large ML dependencies remain uninstalled.

## Consolidation Plan
### Trading Bot Projects
- Use `trading-platform` as the central framework.
- Merge `thetradingrobotplug` and `tradingrobotplug` components (located in `core-engine/trading-robot-plug` and `web-ui/trading-robot-plug-web`) and strategies from `tbow-tactics` into the main project.
- Reuse machine learning utilities from `machine-learning-model-maker` (`mlrobotmaker`) to support strategy development.

### Data Management Projects
- `Datgurll` and `machine-learning-project` contain overlapping data utility scaffolding. Plan to merge them into a single data-workflows module under `unified-workspace/shared`.

## Next Steps
- Integrate `tbow-tactics` and `machine-learning-model-maker` modules into `trading-platform`.
- Consolidate data utilities from `Datgurll` and `machine-learning-project` and archive the redundant repositories.
