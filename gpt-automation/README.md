# GPT Automation

Toolkit for building GPT-driven automation workflows.

## Environment Setup
1. Create a virtual environment.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r environment/requirements.txt
   ```
3. Copy `environment/env.example` to `.env` and add your API keys.

## Status
Planning phase with initial environment scaffolding.

## Progress
- Added `pytest` to requirements and a basic import test for `openai` and `langchain`.
- Import tests pass once dependencies are installed.
- Next step: implement core automation workflows and evaluate integration with `unified-workspace`.
