# Coding & Architecture Standards

## Design Principles
- Favor object-oriented, class-based design to encapsulate behavior and data.
- Ensure each class, module, and function has a single responsibility (Single Responsibility Principle).

## Project Structure
- Use modular design with clear separation of concerns.
- Keep configuration, source, tests, and documentation in dedicated folders.
- Minimize duplication through reusable components and libraries.

## Code Quality
- Follow language-specific style guides (PEP 8 for Python, etc.).
- Enforce linters and formatters in the development workflow.
- Keep functions and methods small and focused.

## Testing
- Maintain unit tests for critical functionality.
- Include integration tests for major workflows.
- Provide example data or fixtures to simplify test setup.

## Security
- Validate all external input and sanitize outputs.
- Store secrets outside the codebase and load them securely at runtime.
- Regularly review dependencies for vulnerabilities.

## Documentation
- Document public functions, modules, and complex logic.
- Keep README and usage examples up to date.
- Include setup instructions and contribution guidelines.
